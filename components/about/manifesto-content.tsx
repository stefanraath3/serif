        The internet has become noisy. Algorithms dictate what we read, and ads
        clutter our thoughts. We believe in a different future.

        Serif was born from a desire to return to the essence of the web:{" "}
        <span className="italic text-stone-900">connection through words.</span>
      </p>

        We optimize for clarity, not clicks. We design for reading, not
        retention. We believe that good typography is an act of kindness to the
        reader.

      <p>This is a space for slow thoughts in a fast world.</p>
